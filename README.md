#Short Projects
Here are some of my shorter projects that are either in progress or have been finished. 
##Line error program 
  A program to find the error in a line of best fit in the IB way
##Veracross program
  Veracross is the online gradebook used by my school. This program retrieves my grades from the website using selenium and then puts them into a csv file on my computer
##Vocabulary finder program
  This program is still very unfinished. The existing code is just some experimenting with ideas such as lemmatization and token frequency for words. The comments in the code are some of my thoughts on how to proceed.
